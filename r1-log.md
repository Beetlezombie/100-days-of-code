## Log

### R1D1 
Started with website for work. PHP and SQL. 
Got the basics down, connecting to the database, creating, updating, deleting info from the database. Built a basic search function for the database. Also found out about the git ignore file, unfortunately to late ... Need to read up on having to ignore certain files to get put in the repo.
