## Log

### R1D3 15.01.2020
Hard at work at portfolio. Almost done. Learned so much about CSS, SASS, and basic Javascript. Amazing what you learn if you persist and spend like 4 hours in the evening just coding like a zombie. So glad I found the 100daysofcode challenge. Guess I needed that kick in the editor for some reason.

### R1D3 14.01.2020
Forgot to update te file. Been working on my portfolio website as an excuse to learn more about the possibilities of SASS. 

### R1D2 13.01.2020
Decided to do some basic stuff. Work on my 'portfolio' website, and learning SASS in the process. Went ahead and installed node.js and npm as well. Was very confused as to why SASS would be beneficial, but now I see how it works (with npm run *script* in the terminal), yeah, kinda cool.
Learned a lot today. A good day to code o7


### R1D1 12.01.2020
Started with website for work. PHP and SQL. 
Got the basics down, connecting to the database, creating, updating, deleting info from the database. Built a basic search function for the database. Also found out about the git ignore file, unfortunately to late ... Need to read up on having to ignore certain files to get put in the repo.
